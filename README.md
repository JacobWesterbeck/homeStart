Improvements currently in development for this extension include:

### Credits

HomeStart serves as my submission for Harvard CS50's Computer Science course. 
Through building this Chrome Extension I have gained knowledge in creating a responsive webpage using Javascript, HTML and CSS. Highlights of what I have learned include:
- Using localstorage
- Working with dates and times in Javascript
- Calling API's and dynamically populating a page with the response
- Using async functions
- Combining CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a webpage that is easy to edit and update
